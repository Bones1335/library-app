# Simple Library App v1

This first version of the Library Web-App uses HTML, CSS, and Javascript to
create an array of books input by the user, displaying those inputs on the
screen. Upon being displayed, the user can toggle the read status of said
book by clicking the true/false button. In addition, the user can click the
'X' in the corner of the generated card to remove that entry from the
library.

*IMPORTANT NOTE:* While there is a search bar and login button at the top
of the screen, they are not yet functional. Their functionality will come
in a later version. Full graphical design will also come in later versions.
